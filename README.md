## Introduction

This repository is a curated collection of coding challenges, algorithms, and data structure problems solved using C++. Each problem is organized by topic, and the solutions are well-documented with comments to help others understand the approach.

## Structure

The repository is organized into directories based on the topic or problem set. For example:

```
- algorithms/
  - sorting/
  - searching/
- data_structures/
  - linked_lists/
  - trees/
- challenges/
  - hackerrank/
  - leetcode/
```

Each directory contains:
- Source code files (`.cpp`).
- A `README.md` file with problem descriptions and explanations.
- Test cases and expected outputs, where applicable.

## Problem List

A comprehensive list of all the problems solved in this repository, along with links to the source code and problem statements, can be found [here](PROBLEM_LIST.md). *(Create this file if you want a dedicated list or remove this section.)*
